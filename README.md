PA04 Line following
Code: Prelimiarily finished
Yet to be done:
    Adjust the valid contour algorithm. It currently works fine, but I suspect it won't work in every instance.
    Adjust the valid contour finder range. It currently considers the whole image. Perhaps it should only consider the bottom half of the image.
    Add a mechanism to help the robot to find its way back to the line when the line is lost in sight. CUrrently it stops as soon as no valid contours are detected

Status: Tested only in simulation in one specific map. Insufficient to determine whether it works in real life.
