#### PA04 Line following
- Code: Prelimiarily finished
- Yet to be done:
    Adjust the valid contour algorithm. It currently works fine, but I suspect it won't work in every instance.
    Add a mechanism to help the robot to find its way back to the line when the line is lost in sight. Currently it stops as soon as no valid contours are detected
- Starter Code: Not Started
- Launch File: Finished
- Status: Tested only in simulation in one specific map. Insufficient to determine whether it works in real life.

How to Run in simulation:
> $ roslaunch mybot_gazebo mybot_world.launch
